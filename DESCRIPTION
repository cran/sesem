Description: Structural equation modeling is a powerful statistical approach for the testing of networks of direct and indirect theoretical causal relationships in complex data sets with inter-correlated dependent and independent variables. Here we implement a simple method for spatially explicit structural equation modeling based on the analysis of variance co-variance matrices calculated across a range of lag distances. This method provides readily interpreted plots of the change in path coefficients across scale.
