Description: Structural equation modeling (SEM) is a powerful statistical
    approach for the testing of networks of direct and indirect theoretical
    causal relationships in complex datasets with intercorrelated dependent and
    independent variables. Here we implement a simple method for spatially
    explicit SEM (SE-SEM) based on the analysis of variance covariance matrices
    calculated across a range of lag distances. This method provides readily
    interpretable plots of the change in path coefficients across scale.
