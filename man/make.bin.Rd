\title{
Function to make lag distance bins
}
\description{
For spatial SEM, lag distance bins need to be described by 2 vectors: binsize and 
binname. make.bin is a function to automatically generate lag distance bins for a 
given dataset. Options to automatically specify bins based on desired within bin sample 
size, or desired number of bins are available.
}
\usage{
make.bin(dist.mat, type = "n.bins", p.dist = 50, n.bins = 10, s.size = 100)
}
\arguments{
  \item{dist.mat}{
a vector containing distances between all X-Y sample pairs in a dataset. 
Produced by function calc.dist
}
  \item{type}{
should a particular number of bins be created ("n.bins"), or should bins each contain 
a particular number of sample pairs ("s.size"), or should all possible bins be created 
("ALL"). Note that "ALL" will only yield sensible results for regular sampling designs.
}
  \item{p.dist}{
Inference distance (i.e. upper limit of largest lag distance bin) as a percentage 
of the maximum distance sampled 
}
  \item{n.bins}{
number of bins to be generated if type="n.bins"
}
  \item{s.size}{
sample size within each bin to be used if type="s.size"
}
}
\details{
make.bin generates cut off values for lag distance bins and corresponding bin names	The function has three default parameter values available, if user does not want to specify:
	
(1) Inference distance as a percentage(p.dist) = 50. This sets the upper limit of the largest bin. Normally lag distances greater than 50% of the maximum sampling extend are not recommended. (2) Number of bins (n.bins) = 10 (3) Sample size (s.size) = 100

You can use type="ALL","n.bins" OR "s.size" to control parameter values. ALL will only produce sensible results for regular sampling designs. The function produces a list object containing (1.)binsize and (2.)binname. These two vectors (binsize and binname) will be used by make.covar to calculate variance covariance matrices for each lag distance bin
	
Special note: User specified number of lag distance bins OR sample size will be used to calculate initial cutoff value of each lag distance bin. However, if the cutoff point is in between a lag distance bin, real cutoff will apply at the upper margin of the particular bin. Therefore, resulting number of bins are less than or equal AND resulting sample sizes are greater than or equal to the value specified by the user.
}
\value{
a List with two components: 
  \item{comp1 }{a vector of bin size cutoff distances starting with zero}
  \item{comp2 }{a character vector of bin names. This vector has one element 
  less than component 1}
