\title{
Function to plot the distribution of lag distance bin sizes
}
\description{
A convenience function that provides a histogram of distances among of all sample pairs and a plot of sample sizes for each the selected bin size.
}
\usage{
plotbin(dist.mat,binsize)
}
\arguments{
  \item{dist.mat}{
a vector of x-y distances among all sample pairs as produced by calc.dist
}
  \item{binsize}{
A vector of bin sizes as produced by make.bin, or of the form c(0,2,3,4,....) where the values are the desired bin cutoffs beginning with zero.
}
}
\details{
This function is to assist in visualization of both the distribution of x-y distances in the dataset and sample sizes resulting from the selected lag distance bins. See the help files for calc.dist and make.bin for the inputs to this function.
